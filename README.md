# Assignment1_IOT
In this collaborative task, students will work as a team to create a python script with multiple functions. Each team member will implement one of the functions and contribute to a shared GitHub repository. The goal is to provide students with experience in collaborative coding, version control, and resolving potential conflicts.


Functions to Implement:

calculate_sum():
Description: This function should take any number of arguments and calculate their sum.
Input: Any number of integer or floating-point arguments.
Output: The sum of the input numbers.

generate_fibonacci():
Description: Generate and print the first N numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.
Input: A single integer argument N representing the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.
Output: The first N Fibonacci numbers separated by spaces.

reverse_string():
Description: Reverse a given string.
Input: A single string argument.
Output: The input string in reversed order.

check_prime():
Description: Check if a given integer is prime or not.
Input: A single integer argument.
Output: Display whether the input number is prime or not.

calculate_average():
Description: Calculate the average of a list of numbers.
Input: Any number of integer or floating-point arguments.
Output: The average of the input numbers.


Count Vowels:
Description: Implement a function to count the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a given string.
Input: A single string.
Output: The count of vowels in the input string.






Prime Factorization:
Description: Implement a function to find and return the prime factors of a given positive integer.
Input: A single positive integer.
Output: A list of prime factors of the input number.

Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculation:
Description: Implement a function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.
Input: Two integers.
Output: The greatest common divisor of the two input numbers.

Check Pangram:
Description: Implement a function to check if a given string is a pangram (contains all letters of the alphabet at least once).
Input: A single string.
Output: Return True if the input string is a pangram, otherwise False.

Word Count:
Description: Implement a function that counts the number of words in a given sentence.
Input: A single string (a sentence).
Output: The count of words in the input sentence.

Fahrenheit to Celsius Conversion:
Description: Implement a function to convert a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
Input: A single floating-point number representing a temperature in Fahrenheit.
Output: The temperature converted to Celsius.


Github instructions: 

Team Formation:
Each team should consist of 5 members.
Assign each team a team leader who will create the GitHub repository.
Repository Setup:
The team leader should create a new GitHub repository and share the repository link with all team members.

Clone the Repository:
All team members should clone the repository to their local machines.
Function Assignment:
Assign each team member one of the functions from the original task description.
Each team member will be responsible for implementing their assigned function in a separate branch.
Branching and Implementation:
Each team member should create a new branch named after their function, e.g., generate_fibonacci.
Implement the assigned function in the respective branch and commit the changes.
Pull Requests:
After implementing the function, each team member should push their branch to the GitHub repository.
Create a pull request for each branch to merge it into the main branch.
Conflict Resolution:
As pull requests are submitted, there might be conflicts when merging. This is expected due to changes in different parts of the script.
Team members should communicate and resolve conflicts as they arise to ensure a clean merge.
Code Review and Merging:
Review each other's pull requests to ensure code quality and correctness.
Once conflicts are resolved and the code is reviewed, the team leader or designated member can merge the pull requests into the main branch.
Final Testing:
After all pull requests are merged, the team should test the final script to ensure all functions work together seamlessly.
Submission:
The final merged script should be in the main branch of the GitHub repository.
Submit the GitHub repository link as the completed task.
Donâ€™t delete the branches created for each function.
